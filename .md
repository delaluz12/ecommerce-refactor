## redux

## state && store
how the UI renders or the state of the application at any given point in time.

the current Redux app state is stored inside an object called 'store'

```
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterReducer })

console.log(store.getState())
// {value: 0}

```


## initial State

inital state should be something like...

per redux docs: 'With Redux, our application state is always kept in plain JavaScript objects and arrays. That means you may not put other things into the Redux state - no class instances, built-in JS types like Map / Set Promise / Date, functions, or anything else that is not plain JS data.'

```
const initialState = {
    products: [],
    cart: [],
    cartOpen: false,
    categories: [],
    currentCategory: '',
}

```
## actions
are dispatched with the payload to the store where the reducer is run 

```
 {type: '', payload:} UPDATE_PRODUCTS = "UPDATE_PRODUCTS";

 {type: '', payload:} ADD_TO_CART = "ADD_TO_CART";
 {type: '', payload:} ADD_MULTIPLE_TO_CART = "ADD_MULTIPLE_TO_CART";
 {type: '', payload:} REMOVE_FROM_CART = "REMOVE_FROM_CART";
 {type: '', payload:} CLEAR_CART = "CLEAR_CART";
 {type: '', payload:} UPDATE_CART_QUANTITY = "UPDATE_CART_QUANTITY";
 {type: '', payload:} TOGGLE_CART = "TOGGLE_CART";

 {type: '', payload:} UPDATE_CATEGORIES = "UPDATE_CATEGORIES";
 {type: '', payload:} UPDATE_CURRENT_CATEGORY = "UPDATE_CURRENT_CATEGORY";

```

### dispatch
use this method to pass in an action onject and update the state

```
store.dispatch({ type: 'actionHERE' })

console.log(store.getState())


```


## reducers
A reducer is a function that receives the current state and an action object, decides how to update the state if necessary, and returns the new state: (state, action) => newState
